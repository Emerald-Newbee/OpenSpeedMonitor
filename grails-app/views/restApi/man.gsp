            <p>Any request URL of the REST-API of the openSpeedMonitor starts with the application path followed by the keyword <code>/rest</code>.
            <br>In the following manual we call this <strong>REST-base-path</strong>.
            <br>All successfully handled requests return their result in JSON notation. Default output format is not pretty-printed (small in size).
            A pretty-printed output can be forced with an URL query argument <code>pretty=true</code>.</p>
